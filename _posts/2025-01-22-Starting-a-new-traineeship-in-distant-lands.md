November 13th, *ring* *ring*, my phone buzzed. I tentatively answered and... to my delight, it's someone from the traineeship I applied for. They want me on their team. How amazing is this. A leading company in Cybersecurity in The Netherlands is offering me a job where I get to learn and certify while working. How amazing is that?

But what do I have to arrange before I start working? 

### Zo veel dingetjes

Having worked in Healthcare and the Military for the last 10 years, the prospect of jumping into IT was a huge change. I'd dabbled in tech, tickled the its whiskers so to speak. I'd had a lot of fun, and I found it interesting, but making it a full time job was something far bigger. Saying goodbye to family and friends, tax, transport, insurance, mileage, inscrijven, verhuizen, reibweis? Ahh where to start? How do I sort out all these things? (Oh, and did I forget to mention it's in a new country? Where I don't live. And don't fully speak the Dutch? And have to start anew?) Thank God my partner is there to help!

But it's all a matter of perspective. An old friend of mine once told me a long story with a great punchline; one of those long-winded ones with far too many dramatic liberties, and I forgot the punchline. But anyway, it boiled down to the old Irish Proverb, "Life is like a cuppa tea, it is what you make of it." And this is a tool that I have always kept in my mental toolbox. Big changes can be challenging, but they also host opportunities.

All of these things, are character building opportunities. Each is a challenge, something that is possible to navigate on it's own, as a small step. Bigger changes are just this, a series of small steps. Each is an opportunity to learn more and move forward with something new. Easy when one thinks of these in this manner.

So  moving country, learning Dutch, renovating our new place, mastering a new trade, navigating the Dutch healthcare system, sorting transportation, buying insurance, registration, suddenly aren't so scary.

### Eerst week

On 6th January, I started at ON2IT. First we had a half-day of walkarounds and team introductions. I have to admit everyone, absolutely everyone, stood up to personally come over and introduce themselves. Everyone was very friendly and our tour of the building was interesting, getting to see the SOC (Security Operations Centre), Development and other departments (HR, Marketing, Sales, Finance, etc) was dead interesting.

But the formalities were quickly over, we had 4 weeks to soak up all the networking knowledge we could because on the first day we sat down with our orientator and book our Cisco CCNA.

By afternoon we were straight into the course with Adrian and Arthur from the Savnet academy. At first I was sceptical about how the course would go, but it was quickly clear that these two guys, frankly...well... *they knew their shit*.

Adrian jumped straight into the Cisco Netacad course and before we knew it the first module was finished. Monday through Friday disappeared in the blink of an eye. I've heard that time passes quicker when you're enjoying what you're working on. Well I think this must be case, Adrian had many packet-tracer labs for us to try. We would quickly cover theory and then focus on practical labs to develop our understanding about networking. At this stage we were focused primarily on distinguishing layer 2 and layer 3 devices, their roles, how the lifecycle of frames and packets translates into reality and the vastness of IOS (*no, not the apple one, the **cisco** one*).

I would stay into the evenings on most days, it would help me skip the 1700 traffic anyway. I would travel northbound on the A15 going past Tiel which would basically be a very long carpark come 5 o'clock. Often I would study with Victor (another trainee) into the evenings. At least that is what we tried to do... more than once did it occur that one of us would pose a question to the other, to which neither of us would know the answer. "What if we set a STP topology do with several bridges marked as the secondary or primary root bridge?" Let's just say almost every study session we would generate a healthy flow of hypothetical and difficult to answer/explain questions for our instructors the next day. To which we were constantly surprised - Arthur and Adrian could explain our curiousities away with ease. Again, *these two knew their shit.*

### Ende van de week

It's surprisingly how quickly team dynamics form. By Friday, everyone was - as we say in Ireland - having *mighty craic*! But we weren't just exchanging stories and good laughs, we were also talking about networking, all of us were genuinely interested and excited in this area of tech. And because we all had differ backgrounds it made for some pretty interesting insights. Satellite engineers, embedded system engineers, AI grads, web developers, healthcare professionals, we had it all. Well if all is a tech workshop with a medical backup then sure!

Come Friday, we had finished the first netacad module. Studying from 0800-1900 most days is intense so it's important to have some home support and some down-time. When I arrived home through the fron door I was delighted to find my Partner waiting for me to join her for a celebratory wijntje. 

*Proost!*
