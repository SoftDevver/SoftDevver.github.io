**Boson ExSim, Jeremy's IT Labs, Cisco NetAcad, Anki flashcards, a couple of Discords, labs, YouTube, a couple of forests' worth of paper notes, more labs.** This has been my last week working from home, or what is probably more appropriately called studying at home. Especially with sunrises on our balcony like the one above (whenever the Dutch weather decides to be kind).

### The Study Method

For me, I study best when I’ve read a concept, understood it, and then tested myself on it. Thankfully, this is something my mother showed me when I was young, as many people simply don’t know how to study in a way that works for them! So, I decided to attack this week’s mountain of CCNA material by first going back through the NetAcad courses for a bit of quick revision, and then completing the module quizzes, checkpoint tests, and practice exams. Together with Jeremy's IT Labs to slow-walk me through anything I didn’t quite understand, this method turned out to be a killer combination.

In the evenings, I would sit with my partner and recap the topics from the day using the Anki flashcards provided by Jeremy's IT Labs. Spreading this out over the week was a good use of time. I did find that jumping between topics kept things interesting. For instance, I’m not as keen on wireless networking—things like CAPWAP and how to use Cisco’s wireless configuration panel. So breaking this up into smaller study sessions made it more digestible for me.

<!--more-->But routing protocols and IP addressing (even IPv6)—wow! I think I covered all of these in just a couple of hours. Something about networking is just so interesting, and I really like how you can see these technologies working straight away by pulling up a packet capture like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and seeing real data flow. Everyone has their own niche areas, and being aware of them is a good way to compensate for areas you may be a touch light on.

### Test Day

On the day, my partner kindly offered to drive me to the Test Centre in [Veenendaal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veenendaal). From experience, I know that trying to cram last minute doesn’t work, but that didn’t stop my stubborn self from flashing through some cards in the car. Didn’t do much, but it did make me feel better! Upon arrival, I was looking for a building called TSTC. I couldn’t find them initially, as their main door in the car park was closed, with a sign in Dutch saying to go around the other side of the building. The other entrance was also locked, but that was before I realised you needed to buzz to get in.

Once inside, I was greeted and shown to the test room and dining room. I have to admit, the TSTC dining room wouldn’t be out of place in a nice hotel—lots of snacks, fruit, tea, and coffee. Sadly, we weren’t allowed to bring any of that into the test room (damn it).

Now, for the test itself, I had to sign an [NDA](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/blogs/a0D3i000002SKIEEA4/the-cisco-candidate-nda-what-it-means-to-you), which is pretty standard in IT certifications. For instance, I had to sign one for my [ISC2 CC](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc) exam last autumn. So, all I can say is that most of the exam was challenging.

Finishing the test, I was convinced I had failed, and by the end, I was already considering when to book my next attempt. But when I clicked the “end exam” button, I froze.

*Congratulations, you have passed.*

What? How? Must be a mistake. Did I break Cisco? Apparently not! I was in such disbelief at that point that I couldn’t stop smiling. The test centre gave me my preliminary results, which again surprised me, as they were actually pretty good. Plus, now I have a good idea of the areas I’m weaker in after the exam. Short of jumping for joy, I quickly went outside to share the news with Lisa. We hastily snapped a picture and didn’t hesitate to book dinner for that evening to celebrate. Yes, this was a nice certification to have, but more importantly, it meant that my ON2IT contract would finally start, and I actually had a job in cybersecurity. Changing careers at 30? Check.

Just as we were about to leave, I saw a colleague of mine, Andrzej, trying to navigate the front door the same way I had done 3 hours ago. Should I just watch him wander around for fun or help him? Ahh, sure, I pointed him in the right direction and wished him luck. Later that day, I was delighted to hear that Andrzej passed, alongside most of the colleagues. Onwards, to starting in the Security Operations Centre and our Palo Alto training! I think we are starting with EDU210 and then moving onto other training.
