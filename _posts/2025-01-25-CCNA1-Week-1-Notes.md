After a long first week, and even longer weekend studying I managed to finish the [Cisco Netacad course](https://www.netacad.com/courses/ccna-introduction-networks?courseLang=en-US_) and the associated reading from [Jeremy&#39;s IT Labs](https://www.jeremysitlab.com/ccna-resources "JITL free course"). I promised my friend Paul√© that I would share these after I flaunted my e-ink tablet during the course. Hopefully they are of use... however, beware. They may be construed as a little messy with the occassional dad tier joke sprinkled through!

I hope to share notes from the other weeks shortly also.
